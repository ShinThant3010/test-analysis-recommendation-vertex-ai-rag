1,multiple_choice,"In Python, what is the value of sum([i for i in range(5) if i % 2 == 0])?","range(5) gives 0,1,2,3,4. The even numbers are 0,2,4, and 0+2+4 = 6.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
2,multiple_choice,"In Python, what is the value of len(set([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]))?","set([1,2,2,3,3,3]) is {1,2,3}, which has length 3.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
3,multiple_choice,"Given s = 'abcdef' in Python, what is the value of s[1:5:2]?","Indices used are 1 and 3, so characters are 'b' and 'd', giving 'bd'.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
4,multiple_choice,"In JavaScript, what does the following print? let a = 1; console.log(a++ + ++a);","a++ returns 1 then a becomes 2; ++a makes a 3, so 1 + 3 = 4.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
5,multiple_choice,"In Python, with a = [1, 2] and b = [1, 2], what does print(a == b, a is b) output?","a and b have the same contents, so a == b is True, but they are different objects in memory so a is b is False.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active

9,multiple_choice,"Solve for x: 2(x − 3) = 3(x + 1).","2x − 6 = 3x + 3 ⇒ -6 − 3 = 3x − 2x ⇒ -9 = x.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
10,multiple_choice,"Consider the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, .... Which description is correct?","Each term increases by 3, so it is an arithmetic sequence with common difference 3.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
11,multiple_choice,"Which SQL query correctly returns the number of orders per customer?","We need to group by customer_id and count rows: SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
12,multiple_choice,"Which JOIN keeps all rows from the left table and matches rows from the right table when possible?","LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, with NULLs when there is no match.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
13,multiple_choice,"Which SQL WHERE clause correctly selects rows with order_date on or after 2025-01-01?","The correct comparison is order_date >= '2025-01-01'.",1,2025-12-08T00:00:00Z,active
